                                    <p>When I was younger, I never really cared about the environment. I would litter without a second thought and didn&#x27;t think twice about wasting energy. But then something amazing happened: I joined Earth Club.</p>
                                    <p>At first, I was skeptical. What could a bunch of kids my age do to make a difference? But soon I learned that we could make a real impact by taking care of our planet. We planted trees, recycled materials, and even
                                        created a garden.</p>
                                    <p>The best part was making friends with other people who share my love for the environment. We bonded over our love of nature and ecology, and it was truly inspiring. Thanks to Earth Club, I&#x27;ve become more environmentally
                                        conscious and now want to help protect our planet.</p>

                                    <p>Growing up in the deep south, I learned to always look for the good in people. It&#x27;s not that we were taught to be naïve and trust everyone, but rather that we were taught to respect others&#x27; journeys. No one
                                        is perfect, and everyone has their own story.</p>
                                    <p>This philosophy served me well as I grew up and began to travel the world. I encountered all sorts of people - from kind-hearted souls to heartless villains. But no matter who they were, I always tried to see the good
                                        in them.</p>
                                    <p>Eventually, this way of thinking became second nature to me. It was like a light inside of me that shone through even the darkest moments. And it was this light that kept me going when things got tough.</p>

                                    <p>There was a time when I lost faith in humanity. I had been hurt one too many times, and it seemed that the world was full of people who only wanted to hurt me. I withdrew from society, convinced that no one could be
                                        trusted.</p>
                                    <p>But then, one day, something happened that changed everything. I was out for a walk when I saw a group of kids bullying another kid. The victim was small and frail, and the bullies were picking on him mercilessly.</p>
                                    <p>I had been through enough pain in my life; I wasn&#x27;t going to stand by and watch this happen. So, I walked up to the bullies and told them to stop. They didn&#x27;t listen until I picked one of them up and slammed
                                        him on a nearby car. I knew I had to do more than just act. The kid and I sat together for hours, drilling him on what to say when approached by bullies. He learned that no matter the outcome you have to fight them
                                        anyway - even with your hands if necessary! They never bother the kid again.</p>

                                        but not a part of your destiny.</p>

                                        know how to listen more than talk, and I think before I speak. This often allows me to express myself better in writing than in conversation.</p>
                                    <p>I believe that these skills are what make me a great writer. My ability to listen and think before speaking allows me to capture the essence of a story, and then express it in a way that is clear and concise. This is
                                        why I love writing so much; it allows me to share my stories with the world, without having to speak them.</p>

                                    <p>I never thought I would learn to live with chronic pain. It was always there, a constant thorn in my side. I didn&#x27;t know how to cope with the constant throbbing and aching in my body. I felt like I had been sentenced
                                        to a life of misery.</p>
                                    <p>But over time, I learned to live with chronic pain. I learned how to get things done even when I was in agony. Yes, there were days when it was tough to get out of bed, but I refused to let my pain keep me from living
                                        my life.</p>

                                        trying to break me down. But I refused to let it win.</p>
                                    <p>I armoured myself with the facts of who I was. It was those brutal truths that gave me strength and courage, and it became my shield against the world&#x27;s attacks. It couldn&#x27;t hurt me anymore. And slowly, over

                                    <p>We were all alone on the island, my uncle, my cousin and I. It was a hot summer day, and the sun beat me mercilessly. We were completely cut off from the rest of the world. We had no phones, no internet, nothing. I
                                        had been walking for hours, and my feet were blistered and sore. I had no idea where I was or where I was going. But then, I saw it. The most beautiful sight I had ever seen in my life. A sign that said, &quot;Welcome
                                        to paradise.&quot;</p>
                                    <p>I walked further in and saw the most amazing things. There were palm trees swaying in the breeze, crystal-clear waterfalls cascading over rocks, and a white sand beach that stretched as far as the eye could see.</p>
                                    <p>As the sun started to go back down, I headed out with my family on a boat. We were able to charge our phones there and see some dolphins that would jump up out of the water every now than before going back under! It
                                        was such an amazing experience seeing this beautiful natural moment for itself because it doesn&#x27;t last long enough or happen often enough- living in the present moment has its benefits.</p>

                                    <p>I remember the day I decided to change my life. It was a moonlit night, and I felt like the stars were following me. Everywhere I looked, people were telling me what I needed to do, how I needed to change. They said
                                        that I wasn&#x27;t good enough and that I would never be happy if I didn&#x27;t listen to them. </p>

                                        them during every award, successful business deal, or any newly acquired knowledge. It was then that I realized they didn&#x27;t live my life - only I could decide what was best for me. The goals others may have
                                        set for me are nothing compared to the goals I will set for myself.</p>

                                    <p>Growing up, I was always inspired by the story of Jack Dempsey. He was a small man that fought against giants and knocked them down. In his younger days, he also fought bullies who often teased him for his high pitched

                                    <p>I was never good at basketball. In fact, I was terrible. I would lose game after game, and for some reason, that just made me want to practise more. Every day for three years, I would go out to the court and dribble
                                        around. And I mean really dribble – no one-handers or flashy moves. Just basic dribbling.</p>
                                    <p>I was inspired by watching players like Allen Iverson, Kobe Bryant and Dwayne Wade play the game. They made it look so easy like they were born to do it. But I knew that wasn&#x27;t the case – they had all put in their
                                        hours of practice too.</p>
                                    <p>Three years later, things changed dramatically. I could now do behind the back moves, dribble in-between the legs and many other moves. I learned to dribble a basketball with ease because I started out being bad at
                                        it. It just goes to show that you can achieve anything if you put your mind to it.</p>

                                        expert in his field inspired me to change the way I presented myself. </p>
                                    <p>I was struck by these lines…</p>
                                    <blockquote><strong>Zed:</strong> Edwards! Let&#x27;s put it on.</blockquote>

                                    <p>So I hit the gym and started working out regularly. I read up on fashion trends and made sure my suit was always sharp. I also started studying the latest technologies and learning everything there was to know about

                                    <p>How wrong I was.</p>
                                    <p>The first few months were frustratingly difficult. Whenever I tried to conjugate a verb or use the correct article, I would mess up royally. My ego was taking a serious beating.</p>
                                    <p>But I stuck with it, because I knew that if I quit now, I might make a habit of quitting things when they get difficult. Learning German was a must. </p>
                                    <p>Every day, I was humbled by how difficult this new challenge was. But eventually, with lots of hard work and determination, things started clicking. And before long, I was able to hold basic conversations in German.</p>

                                    <p>We were kids, just learning about the world and finding our own way. And for us, that meant changing how we talked. We wanted something different, something that would set us apart.</p>
                                    <p>My friend Gary came up with the idea to switch out the word &quot;cool&quot; for &quot;Kewl&quot;. It was perfect. It sounded new and exciting. Kewl was ours.</p>
                                    <p>Everywhere we went, people started to take notice. Our friends, our classmates...everyone started using kewl in their conversations. It was like we had created our own little world where everything was different.</p>
                                    <p>And we loved it.</p>
                                    <p>The best part was that Gary and I were always at the centre of it all.</p>

                                    <p>I was young and new to the workforce, but I had a natural gift for creativity. Everyday, I sat at the front of my office with my designs in plain view. The marketing team could always turn to their right to be inspired
                                        by my work. It was an immense pressure, but it also made me feel alive. Every new assignment was a chance to showcase my skills and impress my colleagues.</p>
                                    <p>They were some of the greatest days of my life. Even now, years later, people look back on that time with admiration and respect. That&#x27;s just how life felt for me. I often found myself acting on stage, but it wasn&#x27;t
                                        an act-it really was my reality and nothing could shake the grip of this feeling until one day when everything changed...</p>

                                    <p>I started my first business in college. I was young and had no idea what I was doing, but I was determined to make it work. Thankfully, I had a few mentors who were willing to help me out. They taught me the ropes and
                                        showed me what it takes to be successful.</p>
                                    <p>Now, I&#x27;m a serial entrepreneur myself. And I can say without a doubt that the biggest thing you need to succeed is bravery. You have to be brave enough to take risks and bold enough to chase your dreams. And above
                                        all, you have to be professional in everything you do. So remember, if you want to start a business, be brave, be bold, and be professional. The sky&#x27;s the limit!</p>

                                        at Benefitfocus and sit in on some big meetings.</p>
                                    <p>I couldn&#x27;t believe my good luck. Everything was paid for - the hotel, flights, and food. It was like a dream come true. As a young professional, it was the coolest experience I&#x27;d ever had.</p>
                                    <p>The meetings went well and I learned a lot about how marketing works in a large company. It was an amazing opportunity that I never would have gotten if not for this trip.</p>
